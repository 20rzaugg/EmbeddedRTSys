##### NEW RUN #####
Beginning run with Rate-Monotonic Analysis (RMA) algorithm.

[time=0]	Launching Task A (Deadline in 4 ticks, 3 work to do).
[time=0]	Switching from idle task to Task A.
[time=3]	Task A finished execution ahead of its deadline.
[time=3]	Switching from Task A to idle task.
[time=4]	Launching Task A (Deadline in 4 ticks, 3 work to do).
[time=4]	Switching from idle task to Task A.
[time=7]	Task A finished execution ahead of its deadline.
[time=7]	Switching from Task A to idle task.
[time=8]	Launching Task A (Deadline in 4 ticks, 3 work to do).
[time=8]	Switching from idle task to Task A.
Simulation has ended. Goodbye!
